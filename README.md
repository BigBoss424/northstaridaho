# northstaridaho
Website for the north star idaho magazine

Will be creating simply the way in which the magazine is perceived online using turn.js.

Finally was able to fully integrate the magazine turn effect into the website itself. I want to eventually add thumbnails at the bottom like in the examples but I don't know how to get the regions working as well as the table of contents. I think if I find someone online who can explain it to me it would make things a lot easier. 

Also want to add a page turning sound effect to the site as well. The only thing left to do is test it on my local server and then test it on a mobile device. 

#Update 1.0
Released the website with the page turn effect. I am currently experimenting with the ability to add a page sound effect for when the user turns each page. I also would like to work on achieving a table of contents, zoom in feature, and a thumbnail gallery at the bottom of the page. We shall see how the progress comes along.
